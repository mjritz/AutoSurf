# AutoSurf
Generation, simulation and analysis of systems containing surface active agents interacting at an interface. 

AutoSurf is a python package designed to facilitate system generation, simulation and analysis of systems containing polymers/surfactants at an interface. AutoSurf provides a collection of tools to smoothly integrate user input, highly optimized third party open-source software and post-simulation analysis. The tool enables a standardized methodology by which saturation of the surface and interfacial tension measurements can be obtained through molecular dynamics simulations. The package has been successfully implemented to study over 500 systems containing surfactants with varying topology at a water vapor-liquid interface.
